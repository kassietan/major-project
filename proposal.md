# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For my major project, I will be expanding on my 2d arrays assignment. This game, commonly known as the sliding block puzzle or sliding tile puzzle, is a grid-based puzzle where the goal is to order the numbers on the board in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom.


For my major project, I'm planning to build online/app verisons of Pacman and Lunar Lander. This program will essentially emulate modern, more capable versions of these games. Complete system customization and multiplayer modes for both games will also be implemented. The interface will also have multiple options to allow you to seamlessly switch between games.

## Need-to-Have List
- option for user to choose the dimensions of the game board (choose from: 3, 4, or 5) 
  - this will a part of the start screen 
  - this will also be applied to when the user restarts the game
- fix the issue with the canvas size (in some instances, the gamebaord and the side buttons will overlap)
- add a delay between solving the puzzle and having the win screen appear

## Nice-to-Have List
- adding some sort of animation element to the game (jQuery)
- adding an auto-solve function
