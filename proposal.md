# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For my major project, I will be expanding on my 2d arrays assignment. This game, commonly known as the sliding block puzzle or sliding tile puzzle, is a grid-based puzzle where the goal is to order the numbers on the board in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom.

## Need-to-Have List
- option for user to choose the dimensions of the game board (choose from: 3, 4, or 5) 
  - this will a part of the start screen 
  - this will also be applied to when the user restarts the game
- fix the issue with the canvas size (in some instances, the gamebaord and the side buttons will overlap)
- add a delay between solving the puzzle and having the win screen appear
- improve the UI
  - specifically, fix the "titles" (i.e. "16 SQUARES")
  - hover effect for the "buttons"
    - fill in the text when hovered
  - make the win screen look a LOT better


## Nice-to-Have List
- adding some sort of animation element to the game (jQuery? CSS?)
- adding an auto-solve function
- sanity check for creating a random grid
  - there is a formula to find out if a given combination is solvable
  - in the "nice-to-have list" because the user still has the option to restart, regardless of solvability 

## Might-Incorporate List
- on-screen timer (showing how much time has elapsed)
- on-screen moves counter
